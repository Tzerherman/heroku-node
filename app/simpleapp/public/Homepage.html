			<h2> Why do we need to save water? </h2>
			<p>
				Water is one of the most vital requirements for human life, and without a safe, reliable supply, 
				our lives would be far worse off. Perth is a very dry city, and as most of our water supply relies
				on rainfall to sustain itself, it's important that we don't use more water than we can replace. Dam
				levels have been falling gradually over the past few years, so it's more important now than ever to 
				really think about our water use.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use water not only to drink, but also to clean our clothes and dishes, wash our cars, water our gardens,
				and perform many other basic tasks that we take for granted in our everyday lives. If we continue to comsume 
				our water resources at the current rate, we may have to cut back on many of these basic activities.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's also important to consider the future of our city. Low water availability may cause inconveniences for us,
				but our children and grandchildren may face serious shortages. Cutting back your water use today will help to
				ensure access to water for future generations.
			</p>
			<h2> What can you do? </h2>
			<p>
				Many peopel don't realize just how much water they use every day, and if everyone makes some small, easy changes,
				it can add up to a lot of water across the entire city, or even the nation. There are many steps you can take to 
				reduce your daily water use without compromising on your lifestyle, and they can make a big difference to your 
				water bills. Here are some simple changes you can make every day to reduce your water consumption:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Turn the tap off while brushing your teeth. </li>
				<li> Reduce your reticulation times by 2 minutes - your garden can handle it! </li>
				<li> Wait until the dishwasher is full before turning it on. </li>
				<li> Cut down on shower times by washing as quickly as possible. </li>
				<li> Only wash your clothes when there are enough for a full load. </li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<h2> What is this site for? </h2>
			<p>
				This site is designed to help you get started on your path towards lowering your water consumption and helping to ensure 
				a plentiful supply for future generations. We provide a brief introduction to common water saving ideas, and offer you links
				to sites that can further improve your knowledge and your water use in the hope that you will follow them and do your best to 
				adapt some of the recommendations into your everyday life. The game found here provides a fun and interactive way to
				get into the mindset of saving water, and to get you ready to start making small changes each day.
